              The advent of the Catholic Church to Amarata Community was just
              like the same adventures of the church in other parts of the
              Country. A lot of obstacles and difficulties were encountered and
              surmounted before the church took its root. Before the coming of
              the Catholic faith, the church Missionary Society (CMS) had
              already started their Missionary activities here, however the
              arrival of the Catholic faith brought by late Chief Odumgba
              Agbalikkia brought a religious revolution with the conversion of
              both the CMS members and the pagans to the Catholic faith,hence
              the establishment of the Roman Catholic Church in Amarata by one
            </p>
            <p>
              {" "}
              Rev. Fr. Matthias who opened the first Catholic Church in
              Epie/Atissa clans in 1910, and named the Church St. Matthias
              Amarata and as a matter of fact all the Epie/Atissa Communities
              were introduced to Christianity in 1911. Among the early converts
              were late Obitom Ekpeme, who was the first station chairman, late
              Johnson Ekpeme, late Solomon A. Otiti-Kpuru aka FNB (Fear
              No-Body). Others were late Joshua Opopo, late Nathan Fakimi, late
              Sunday Odumgba, Late Orku Ayowei, Late Victor Ozuagbala and a host
              of other very devoted, faithful and hard-working Christians were
              the pioneers of Catholicism in this area, and to them we give
              credit for accepting the Catholic and Apostolic faith, the true
              Church to Amarata Community. The quest for salvation in the
              Catholic faith by the early converts was not easy and smooth as
              the people had to make tedious journey through the thick forest of
              Kpansiaen-route to Imiringi, Nembe and Brass with the loads on
              their heads to bring Rev. Fathers and later paddle back home via
              Abonnema and Nembe. It will be recalled that the establishment of
              the Church was associated with some painful and agonizing
              occurrences.
            </p>
            <p>
              The early converts were faced with questions about their own
              ancestral worships by their own relatives. Quarrels arose from
              different quarters over this. But in spite of all these hurdles,
              the Church came to stay and has indeed stayed because of the
              preparedness of the people, some of the physical obstacles which
              could have doubted their faith and zeal were overcome. HRM. King
              Festus J. Agulata of blessed memory became the first area
              Catechist in Amarata in the early 40s.
            </p>
            <p>
              For several years, the people passed through a lot of painful
              experiences like trek through the thick forest of Kpansia via
              Okaki bush to Mbiama,a distance of 30 Kilometers, hired canoe and
              paddled via Join karama to Omoku, Okwuzi and Oguta via the Orashi
              River, on the very duty to seek for salvation. St. Matthias had
              passed through the tutelage of many parishes as an out - station
              at one time or the other. Amarata station was at a point an
              outpost of Abonnema{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Parish and was administered from Port Harcourt under the Vicariate
              of Onitsha, under His Grace Most Rev. Dr. Charles Heerey of
              blessed memory, it latter become part of the vicariate of Owerri
              and was administered from Oguta Parish. Amarata continued to be in
              the Diocese of Owerri and later was transferred to the new parish
              of Ahoada, which became part of the new Diocese of Port- Harcourt
              in 1961 under the auspices of Most Rev. Dr. G.P Okoye of Blessed
              Memory. Before St. Matthias attained the status of a Parish
              (before the Nigerian/Biafran civil war 1967-1970) several
              missionary priests and Nigerian priests served at various times in
              Amarata, worthy of mentioning are Rev. Fr. Matthias, Rev. Father
              O. Conor, Rev. Fr. Carroll, Rev. Fr. Youngu, Rev. Fr. Mokoyi, Rev.
              Father Millet, other were Rev. Father P. Maize, Rev. Father
              Horrigan and Rev. Father Egan.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the Civil war in 1970, came Rev. Father P. Omole and Rev.
              Father Christo Obieh1970-71, Rev. Father Thomas Brown and Rev.
              Father Eugene Bree took their turn in June 1973 - February 1975,
              then Rev. Father Charles Agu1975 -1976, Rev. Father Rogers
              Kinane1976 - 1977, Rev. Father Noel Dumphy1977 - 1979, Rev. Father
              John Collins1979 - 1980, Rev. Father Richard Burke March 1980 -
              Dec. 1980, Rev. Father Niall Geaney July 1981 – September 1981,
              Rev. Father Joseph Rabbit' November, 1981 - 1982, then came Rev
              Father L. Boniko1982 - 1983 and Msgr. ¬Peter Ohochukwu February,
              1984 -December, 1985. He introduced the Legion of Mary society and
              encouraged the parishioners to move for the creation of the
              Parish. It is worthy to state here that between 1910 to the early
              eighties, Amarata was known as a Catholic Community, because there
              were no other church(es) in the community, eighty five percent of
              the villagers were Catholics with an exception of few persons who
              kept to the worship of their idols. However, upon the death of the
              first Catechist HRM King Festus J. Agulata in 1981, his younger
              brother, Late HRM. King Charles B. Agulata, who was one of the
              very strong Catholic and a great composer of Epie Songs in the
              Church (as he usually took the Church choristers to Port-Harcourt
              for singing competitions and often returned with victory), left
              the Church with his entire house hold for the fear of the unknown
              and brought to the community the Brotherhood of the cross and
              star, as such members were scattered and only very few were left
              in the Catholic Church, and those who left the Church went in
              search of immediate solution to their spiritual problems. This
              religion spread in Amarata Community and beyond. But a million
              thanks to Late Catechist Simon D. Obuku, aka (Youngest Catechist)
              and his entire family and the very few persons who held on the
              faith and kept the Church going.{" "}

              We also wish to remember the cooperation of members from Ekeki
              station and Yenizue- Epie and few other Epie stations for standing
              firm to protect the image and the faith of the Church. The
              movement for the creation of the Parish actually began in 1978,
              when all the stations making up the then proposed Amarata Parish
              doubled their efforts to have a resident Parish Priest. These
              stations includes; Amarata, Yenagoa, Famgbe, Ekeki-Epie,
              Yenizue-Epie, Agudama-Epie Mbiama Akinima, Okaki, lkodi and
              Igebiri respectively.

              A four man delegation which included Late Catechist Martins Izu,
              okaki, Sir Catechist, Augustine Nwobu, and Late Mr. Christopher
              Eze Nwapa, Yenagoa, Late Catechist Simon D. Obuku, Amarata, was
              set up to always meet with the Bishop at Port- Harcourt from time
              to time to fine-tune the creation of the Parish. The delegation
              met with the Bishop severally and the Bishop told them all that
              were required before Amarata would be given a parish. Again the
              people came together in one accord to meet up with the
              requirements for the priest’s residence. In August 1985 the
              delegation in company of the Parish Priest of St. Peters Catholic
              Church Ahoada, Msgr Peter Ohochukwu who was in charge of all the
              stations in this area finally met with the Bishop and an approval
              was given, and after the completion of some of the major
              requirements in October 1985 the Bishop Most Rev. Dr. E. J.
              Fitzigibbon of blessed memory came in person to inspect the
              priest's residence, after being satisfied with what he saw and
              coupled with the zeal of the people, the Bishop immediately posted
              the pioneer parish priest, Rev. Father Charles Oferember of
              Blessed memory, who reported in Amarata on December 24
              <sup>th</sup> 1985.
            </p>
            <p>
              The inauguration of the parish took place on the 14<sup>th</sup>{" "}
              February 1987 by His Lordship Most Rev. Dr. E.J Fitizigibbon the
              Catholic Bishop of Port Harcourt - Diocese at the St. Matthias,
              Primary School field otherwise now known, as OMPADEC field with a
              very colourful celebration which includes the confirmation of over
              hundred candidates and many other events. The introduction of the
              Catholic prayer league by the pioneer parish priest brought to a
              very large extent, a great conversion of souls to the Church many
              persons received the sacraments of baptism and Holy Matrimony.
              Over the years the Church worshipped at the St. Matthias Primary
              School open hall. The first Church building that was erected by
              the few members then at one end-of the present St. Matthias
              Primary School field, which was at the roofing level, was
              destroyed by a very heavy storm in 1988. The Church then moved to
              the portion of land beside the old father’s residence where ECO
              Bank was operating¬. That land was given to the Church by Late
              Chief G.M. Odumbga, where a temporary thatch house was put on for
              worship, until HRM King Alfred Diete-Spiff, Chairman, Bayelsa
              State council of traditional rulers, graciously gave the Church
              this site upon which we are building this new edifice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let it be on record that the first Church building which was
              erected here, received a grant of hundred thousand naira
              (#100,000.00) from Rome and support from St. Patrick’s Society
              Kiltegan, Ireland, was demolished to accommodate this new one. We
              lack words to express our sincere gratitude to Rev. Father Thomas
              Brown of blessed memory for the pains he took in contacting the
              donor HRM King Alfred Diete-Spiff, who without much ado gave us
              this land in 1994.{" "}

            <p>
              Upon the creation of Bomadi jurisdiction in 1991, Amarata and
              Imringi Parishes were carved out, from Port Harcourt Diocese and
              merged to Bomadi Jurisdiction under the pastoral care of St.
              Patrick's society Kiltegan Ireland. The Jurisdiction was-
              inaugurated in March 1992 with Msgr Thomas V. Greenan as the
              Ecclesiastical superior. Prior to the takeover of Schools by the
              Government, the Catholic Church, had then two schools which were;
              St. Matthias' Primary School founded in 1911 and St. Jude’s Girls
              Secondary School founded in 1962 both in Amarata. St. Matthias
              ¬Primary School had classes up to standard two (std. 2) in the
              early days and in the early thirties it read up to standard four
              (std.4) and from the fifties it had standard six (std.6). St.
              Mathias Primary School Amarata was the first to read up to
              standard six (std.6) in Epie/Atissa clans, while St. Jude's Girls
              Secondary School Amarata was the first Girls College in this Area
              in the old Rivers State then, With Rev. Father Horrigan as the
              pioneer principal in 1963. However, the two schools were taken
              over by the Government after the Nigerian/Biafra War. In 1997 the
              Church established the St. Matthias group of Schools comprising
              Nursery/Primary and the College and it was rated one of the best
              private schools in Bayelsa State.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though the Catholic Church had existed in this area for over 100
              years, it had produced only one person from the community into the
              priesthood in the person of Rev. Fr. Izibeya Samuel Victor who was
              the Parish Priest and two other religious sisiter; Rev. Sis
              Justina Suekime Nelson and Rev. Sis. Jacinta Keseibo Stephen.
              While two seminarians are in their formation. They are; Hyacinth
              Agulata and Paschal Odeke. From the creation of this Parish in
              December 1985 to date these Rev. Fathers have served as Parish
              Priest. They are Rev. Fr. Charles Oferember 1985 - 1989, Rev. Fr.

              To God be the Glory, this is how far the Catholic Church have
              journeyed over the years in Amarata. However, we cannot conclude
              this brief history, without acknowledging the contributions of all
              the Parishes that were later created out of St. Matthias Amarata,
              particularly St. Patrick's Ovom, Yenagoa and all those who worked
              tirelessly until Amarata attain a Parish status and equally
              sustained it till date. May the good Lord bless you all. Amen.
